# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-ML-GUI-
A machine learning project that predicts individual health insurance costs using personal and lifestyle factors. Built with Python, visualized via EDA, and deployed through a GUI.

# ðŸ’¬ Project Description:
This project aimed to predict health insurance costs based on user inputs like age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children. Using a real-world dataset, I cleaned the data, handled missing values, engineered features (like BMI category), and explored correlations through EDA.

I trained six different regression models â€” including Linear Regression, KNN, SVR, and XGBoost â€” and finalized Random Forest Regressor due to its high accuracy (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.85) and low error.

To make it user-friendly, I also developed a Tkinter-based GUI that allows anyone to input values and get an instant insurance price prediction. The model was saved using joblib and is fully functional through the desktop interface.

From data science to deployment, this project walks through the full ML lifecycle â€” solving a practical, real-world problem with data-driven insights.
